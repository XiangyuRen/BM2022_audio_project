### Start the collector program
`$> python3 conversation_collector`

## Priorities
[Prio] until 5/31

### Art
- [MED][---] Sound sculpture - design & implement different play styles
  - By implementing sculptor.reshape_audio() logic
- [LOW][---] Sound sculpture - switch to different styles per hour in day / number of files / etc.

### Platform
- [HIGH][milton] Recorder - when player uses external speaker - TODO: fix this when using an external speaker
- [LOW][---] UI/UX - add more ideas / poems to the Poet

- [HIGH][milton] Make a POC shell
  - ...and assemble it with full features. Then schedule time to demo this around.
- [MED][milton] Build the Playa Pole
- [LOW][---] Make a robust and aesthetically pleasing shell
  - Ideally we can have some artist to do this
  - Directly out of wood? or 3D printed w/ heat-resistant materials?
- [LOW][---] Playa installation solution: Harsh environment
  - the whole thing needs to be resistant to STRONG wind / heat / rain
